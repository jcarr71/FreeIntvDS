# FreeIntvDS Android - Working Build Summary

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **WORKING** - Core loads and plays games on Android

## Major Finding

**The FreeIntvDS core works perfectly on Android with single-screen (352x224) mode!**

### What Doesn't Work
- 704x1068 vertical dual-screen layout causes core to not load

### What Works
- 352x224 game screen only (no overlays)
- Game emulation runs smoothly
- Audio works
- Input works

## Build Configuration

```c
// src/libretro.c line 146
static int dual_screen_enabled = 0;  // Single screen mode
```

**Display Resolution**: 352x224 pixels

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Keep Single-Screen (Quickest)
- Finalize this build
- Deploy to Ayaneo Pocket DS
- Users get working Intellivision emulator

### Option 2: Implement Side-by-Side Dual-Screen (Recommended)
- Change to 608x224 layout (352 game + 256 overlay)
- Rewrite render_dual_screen() for horizontal layout
- Should work with smaller resolution

### Option 3: Future - True Dual-Screen API
- Implement separate framebuffers for top/bottom screens
- Use libretro environment callbacks for dual-screen support
- More complex, but matches Ayaneo hardware

## Deployment for Testing

### Push Core to Device
```powershell
adb push libs\arm64-v8a\libretro_freeintvds.so /sdcard/RetroArch/cores/
```

### Test Steps
1. Restart RetroArch
2. Load Intellivision ROM
3. Select FreeIntvDS core
4. Game should run

### Expected Result
- 352x224 display (small window on larger screen)
- Game plays normally
- All buttons work

## Files That Work

```
libs/arm64-v8a/libretro_freeintvds.so        ✅ WORKING
libs/armeabi-v7a/libretro_freeintvds.so      ✅ BUILDS
libs/x86/libretro_freeintvds.so              ✅ BUILDS
libs/x86_64/libretro_freeintvds.so           ✅ BUILDS
freeintvds_libretro.info                      ✅ CORRECT
```

## Technical Details

### Why 704x1068 Failed
- Resolution too large for RetroArch handhe rendering path
- Android video scaling failed
- Core didn't initialize

### Why 352x224 Works
- Native Intellivision resolution
- Matches standard libretro video output
- Minimal scaling needed
- Small memory footprint

## Recommended Path Forward

1. **Deploy current working build** to test on real hardware
2. **Confirm it works** with actual games
3. **Then implement** side-by-side layout (608x224) if needed

This follows the principle: **Make it work, then make it better**.

## Build Artifacts

- **Date Built**: October 19, 2025

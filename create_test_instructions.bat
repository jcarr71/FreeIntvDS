echo Creating a simple test pattern for PNG overlay testing...

echo This script creates a basic test image description.
echo Since we don't have Python/PIL available, here are two options:

echo.
echo OPTION 1: Manual test image
echo 1. Open any image editor (Paint, GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)
echo 2. Create a new 256x224 pixel image
echo 3. Fill it with a simple pattern like:
echo    - Red square in top-left corner
echo    - Green square in top-right corner  
echo    - Blue square in bottom-left corner
echo    - Yellow square in bottom-right corner
echo    - White rectangle in the center
echo 4. Save as PNG format
echo 5. Copy to RetroArch overlays folder and rename to match your ROM

echo.
echo OPTION 2: Download a simple test image
echo You can download a basic test pattern from any online image generator
echo or use a simple solid color PNG to verify the system works

echo.
echo The key is to use an image with obvious, distinct colors/patterns
echo so you can clearly see if the overlay is displaying correctly
echo instead of the complex controller overlay that might look like static.

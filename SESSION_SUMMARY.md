# Session Summary - October 15, 2025

## What We Accomplished Today

### ðŸŽ‰ Major Achievement
Successfully completed production-ready dual-screen overlay system for FreeIntvDS!

### âœ… Code Cleanup
1. Removed all debug printf statements
2. Removed FILE* debug_log code
3. Removed test comments and temporary code
4. Renamed functions for clarity:
   - `test_function()` â†’ `render_dual_screen()`
   - `test_buffer` â†’ `dual_screen_buffer`
5. Removed hardcoded paths
6. Production-ready, clean codebase

### âœ… Overlay System Final Implementation
**Problem Solved**: RetroArch extracts ZIPs to temp, making overlay path detection difficult

**Solution**: Store overlays in RetroArch system directory
- Location: `<RetroArch>/system/freeintvds-overlays/`
- Naming: Match ROM filename (e.g., `Astrosmash (USA, Europe).jpg`)
- Fallback: `default.jpg` or `default.png` for games without specific overlays
- Works with ZIPs: ROM name extracted from temp path, matched to overlay

### âœ… Image Quality Improvement
Upgraded from nearest-neighbor to **bilinear interpolation**:
- Smooth scaling of overlay images
- Better quality on text and diagonal lines
- Proper alpha blending between pixels
- Maintained aspect ratio preservation

### âœ… Documentation
Created comprehensive documentation:
1. **OVERLAY_SETUP.md** - Detailed user guide for overlay setup
2. **STATUS.md** - Current development status and next steps
3. **README.md** - Updated with dual-screen features

### ðŸ”§ Technical Details

**Build Status**: âœ… Clean compilation
- No errors
- One harmless warning (format-security)
- Output: `freeintvds_libretro.dll` (194,560 bytes)

**Testing**: âœ… Working on Windows RetroArch
- Dual-screen rendering confirmed
- Overlay loading from system directory confirmed
- Bilinear scaling quality verified
- ZIP extraction handling verified

## Files Modified
- `src/libretro.c` - Main implementation (cleaned and finalized)
- `README.md` - Updated with dual-screen info
- `OVERLAY_SETUP.md` - New user guide
- `STATUS.md` - New development status doc

## Next Session Priorities

### 1. Android Build (Primary Goal)
- Use NDK build system in `jni/` directory
- Test on Ayaneo Pocket DS hardware
- Verify dual-screen display on actual device

### 2. Testing
- Verify overlay visibility on small screens
- Test multiple games
- Performance profiling on Android

### 3. Future Enhancements
- Touch input mapping for overlay buttons
- Configurable overlay opacity
- Multiple overlay sets per game

## How to Continue on Another Computer

### 1. Pull Repository
```bash
git pull origin master
```

### 2. Windows Build
```powershell
mingw32-make
```

### 3. Test Setup
Create overlay directory:
```
C:\RetroArch-Win64\system\freeintvds-overlays\
```

Add your overlay images (PNG or JPG) named to match ROM files.

### 4. Android Build (Next Step)
```bash
cd jni
ndk-build
```

## Key Takeaways
- System directory approach was the right solution (simpler, more reliable)
- Bilinear interpolation significantly improved image quality
- Clean, production-ready code ready for deployment
- Documentation complete for users and future development

## Status: âœ… READY FOR ANDROID DEPLOYMENT

# Conversation summary — FreeIntvDS changes

Date: 2025-10-13

Summary of actions performed by the assistant in this session:

- Created or updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with repository-specific guidance (architecture, build, patterns, examples).
- Added a `freeintvds` build target in `Makefile` which builds a separate core named `freeintvds_libretro.*` and passes `-DFREEINTV_DS`.
- Updated `Makefile.common` to accept an `EXTRA_SOURCES` variable and appended it to `SOURCES_C`.
- Added `src/ds_stub.c` — a minimal placeholder module compiled when building FreeIntvDS.
- Modified `src/libretro.c` so the core identifies as `FreeIntvDS` / `1.2-ds` when compiled with `-DFREEINTV_DS`.
- Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to document the new build target and DS-specific guidance.
- Attempted to run `make freeintvds` here but `make` was not available in the environment.
- Attempted a simulated Linux build (Docker/gcc) — neither Docker nor gcc were available here, so the build could not be executed in this environment.
- Updated the `freeintvds` target to automatically include `src/ds_stub.c` via `EXTRA_SOURCES`.

Files added/edited in this session (key ones):
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — documentation for AI agents
- `Makefile` — `freeintvds` target
- `Makefile.common` — `EXTRA_SOURCES` support
- `src/ds_stub.c` — DS placeholder
- `src/libretro.c` — conditional library name/version
- `CONVERSATION.md` — this file
- `scripts/install_wsl.ps1` — WSL installation helper script (see below)

How to continue on your other computer
1. Push this repo to a remote (GitHub), then on the other machine `git clone` or `git pull` the repo.
2. Run the WSL install script (if on Windows and you want to automate WSL feature enablement): see `scripts/install_wsl.ps1` and run it as Administrator.
3. Build FreeIntvDS inside WSL or another Linux environment:
   - `make freeintvds` from the repo root

If you want me to open a PR or add more DS scaffolding (framebuffers, init/shutdown hooks), say which piece to add next.
